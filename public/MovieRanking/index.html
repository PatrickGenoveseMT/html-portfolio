<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Apollo 13</h3>
<p>
    Apollo 13 is a masterpiece, there will be no more movies like this ... we have good movies, based on real facts, no
    one managed to make me feel like I felt this movie, I felt like I was there.
    This movie made me feel claustrophobic, I felt stuck there, cold, scared, hopeless ... an amazing feeling that the
    movie managed to give me.
<p>
</p>
The film is extremely accurate film and very entertaining, it manages to keep you glued to the chair, at the end I
remembered that about halfway through the film, I wanted to go for a beer, but I forgot ... the film said you stay
here until the end.
</p>
<p>The story was incredibly exciting, Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert of the Apollo 13 find themselves stranded
    when their spacecraft gets damaged.NASA tries to bring them back.

    huge joy to see Ed Harris. This was such a great movie, accurate, a superb and legendary movie

<h3>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring movie has successfully opened the door into Tolkien's world of Middle
    Earth for me. The plot tells of the quest of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided
    in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. The costumes,
    weapons, armor, the One Ring and the props are so rich and very well crafted by the film crew. The scenery and
    landscapes of New Zealand are very beautiful. The movie sets for the Shire, Rivendell, Lothlorien, Amon Hen,
    Weathertop, Bree, Isengard and Moria are very gorgeous. The realm of Mordor looks very dark and scary in a good way.
    The action and battle scenes at Weathertop, Moria and Amon Hen are epic, memorable and perfectly executed. The
    special effects for the Balrog, the cave troll, the Watcher in the water, Gollum and Sauron's Eye are very
    incredible. The Prologue scene narrated by Galadriel and with flashbacks of the forging of the Great Rings, the War
    of the Last Alliance and the One Ring passing to Isildur, Sm√©agol and Bilbo was a clever way for Peter Jackson to
    introduce the Lord of the Rings story. The acting is superb The cast crew is so awesome and do an excellent job in
    playing their roles. Sir Ian McKellen is flawless in his role as Gandalf the Grey. Sir Christopher Lee
    isirreplaceable in his performance as Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett captures Lady Galadriel perfectly with a
    wonderfully deep and emotional voice. Elijah Wood is very gifted and bright in his role as Frodo Baggins with the
    charcter's haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures. Sean Astin was born for the role as Samwise Gamgee and does
    an amazing job in capturing Sam Gamgee's personality. Dominic Monaghan Billy Boyd make for a delightful duo as Merry
    and Pippin Viggo Mortenson was an excellent choice for the role as Aragorn/Strider. Orlando Bloom pulls off Legolas
    very nicely with the character's bowmanship, various movements and fighting skills. John Rhys-Davies is brilliant
    and hilarious as Gimli the dwarf. Sean Bean gave an excellent performance as Boromir. Hugo Weaving gives a wonderful
    performance as Lord Elrond. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking in her role as Arwen Evenstar. Andy Serkis gives
    an amazing performance as Gollum. Ian Holm literally is Bilbo Baggins. Craig Parker is very good as Haldir. Howard
    Shore is a musical genius is composing splendid songs and outstanding music scores that capture the spirit and the
    essences of Tolkien's world of Middle Earth. "May It Be" by Enya is a hauntingly beautiful song that plays at the
    credits. Peter Jackson's "The Fellowship of the Ring" is an epic, incredible experience for me. A truly spectacular
    adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever adapt into a movie. This still is a major milestone in
    cinema history.

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>"The Shawshank Redemption" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time since its release in 1994.
    Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this film is a testament to the power of
    storytelling and the indomitable human spirit.</p>
<p>Set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the life of Andy Dufresne (played
    brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder. As the story unfolds, we witness Andy's
    resilience and unwavering hope, which not only transforms his own life but touches the hearts of those around him.
</p>
<p>Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis "Red" Redding is nothing short of iconic. His narration provides a rich and
    insightful perspective, serving as the soul of the film. Freeman's performance is both poignant and deeply moving,
    capturing the essence of a man who finds redemption in the most unexpected of places.</p>
<p>The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances, each character contributing to the tapestry of the prison's
    microcosm. Bob Gunton as the ruthless Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley bring an
    intimidating presence that contrasts starkly with the hope Andy embodies.</p>
<p>One of the film's most striking elements is its cinematography, expertly handled by Roger Deakins. The visuals
    seamlessly transition between the harsh reality of prison life and the transcendent moments of freedom and hope. The
    juxtaposition of light and darkness, both literally and metaphorically, underscores the film's central themes.</p>
<p>Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score serves as the perfect companion to the narrative. The music elevates the
    emotional resonance of every scene, drawing the audience deeper into the characters' struggles and triumphs.</p>
<p>What sets "The Shawshank Redemption" apart is its ability to touch the human soul on a profound level. It speaks to
    the universal desire for redemption, the belief in the possibility of transformation, and the enduring power of
    hope. The script, penned by Darabont himself, is a work of art, interweaving moments of heart-wrenching despair with
    those of profound inspiration.</p>
<p>In the end, "The Shawshank Redemption" is a cinematic triumph that lingers long after the credits roll. It reminds us
    that, no matter the circumstances, the human spirit has the capacity to rise above adversity and find solace in the
    most unexpected places. This film is not just a classic; it is a timeless testament to the resilience of the human
    soul. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and watch this extraordinary piece of cinema.</p>
